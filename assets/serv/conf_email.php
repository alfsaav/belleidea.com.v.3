FormToEmail DESCRIPTION







FormToEmail is a contact-form processing script written in PHP. It allows you to place a form on your website which your visitors can fill out and send to you.  The contents of the form are sent to the email address (or addresses) which you specify below.  The form allows your visitors to enter their name, email address and comments.  The script will not allow a blank form to be sent.







Your visitors (and nasty spambots!) cannot see your email address.  The script cannot be hijacked by spammers.







When the form is sent, your visitor will get a confirmation of this on the screen, and will be given a link to continue to your homepage, or other page if you specify it.







Should you need the facility, you can add additional fields to your form, which this script will also process without making any additional changes to the script.  You can also use it to process other forms.  The script will handle the "POST" or "GET" methods.  It will also handle multiple select inputs and multiple check box inputs.  If using these, you must name the field as an array using square brackets, like so: <select name="fruit[]" multiple>.  The same goes for check boxes if you are using more than one with the same name, like so: <input type="checkbox" name="fruit[]" value="apple">Apple<input type="checkbox" name="fruit[]" value="orange">Orange<input type="checkbox" name="fruit[]" value="banana">Banana







** PLEASE NOTE **  If you are using the script to process your own forms (or older FormToEmail forms) you must ensure that the email field is named correctly in your form, thus: <input type="text" name="email" etc>.  Note the lower case "email".  If you don't do this, you won't be able to see who the email is from and the script won't be able to check the validity of the email.  If you are using the form code below, you don't need to check for this.







This is a PHP script.  In order for it to run, you must have PHP (version 4.1.0 or later) on your webhosting account, and have the PHP mail() function enabled and working.  If you are not sure about this, please ask your webhost about it.







SETUP INSTRUCTIONS







Step 1: Put the form on your webpage



Step 2: Enter your email address and (optional) continue link below



Step 3: Upload the files to your webspace







Step 1:







To put the form on your webpage, copy the code below as it is, and paste it into your webpage:







<form action="FormToEmail.php" method="post">



<table border="0" bgcolor="#ececec" cellspacing="5">



<tr><td>Name</td><td><input type="text" size="30" name="name"></td></tr>



<tr><td>Email address</td><td><input type="text" size="30" name="email"></td></tr>



<tr><td valign="top">Comments</td><td><textarea name="comments" rows="6" cols="30"></textarea></td></tr>



<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><input type="submit" value="Send"><font face="arial" size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://FormToEmail.com">Form Mail</a> by FormToEmail.com</font></td></tr>



</table>



</form>











Step 2:







Enter your email address.







Enter the email address below to send the contents of the form to.  You can enter more than one email address separated by commas, like so: $my_email = "info@example.com"; or $my_email = "bob@example.com,sales@example.co.uk,jane@example.com";







*/













//$my_email = "alfsaav@hotmail.com"; //Test Email   <==== Change email here!!!

$my_email = "alfsaav@gmail.com"; //   <==== Change email here!!!
/*

Enter the continue link to offer the user after the form is sent.  If you do not change this, your visitor will be given a continue link to your homepage.







If you do change it, remove the "/" symbol below and replace with the name of the page to link to, eg: "mypage.htm" or "http://www.elsewhere.com/page.htm"







*/







$continue = "/";







/*







Step 3:







Save this file (FormToEmail.php) and upload it together with your webpage containing the form to your webspace.  IMPORTANT - The file name is case sensitive!  You must save it exactly as it is named above!







THAT'S IT, FINISHED!







You do not need to make any changes below this line.
