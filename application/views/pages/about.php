<h1>The man behind scenes:</h1> <h1 id="my_name"> Alfredo Saavedra (Alfie)</h1>
 
 <p>
Although I have a degree in mechanical engineering, I have decided to persue my passion:  communicating and expressing ideas through art and technology. I always had an inclination for the arts, first by drawing and painting, and now after I taught myself how to use more advanced tools for web and graphic design, and gained real world experience, I have decided to establish myself as an independent freelance web designer.</p>
